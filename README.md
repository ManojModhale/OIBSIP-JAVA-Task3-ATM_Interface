To Understand this repository Please read "READMe.md" file.
this is eclipse Java Project Structure,so Java files are in src folder.<br>

In this repository, I have posted task-3 that I have completed during my internship at "Oasis Infobyte".  <br>
I have completed Internship 'Task-3', Which involves creating a "ATM Interface", I have made Command line Menu Driven ATM Interface using Core Java concepts.<br>
Where user can withdraw, deposit & transfer money. also can check Balance.<br>
there are 3 files, but if you have to run it task you have to run 'ATM.java' file.  <br>
file name = Transaction.java    <br>
file name = BankAccount.java    <br>
main method file name = ATM.java  <br>
